  <h1>Vite + React + Router + TailwindCss + JIT</h1>
</p>

This template allows you to quickly scaffold a React project with React Router, TailwindCss with JIT Compiler and vite as a bundler. We use Vite because it's much faster than webpack. We use tailwindcss JIT compiler because it makes tailwindcss build time negligible and offers more features that you can check here [Tailwind JIT](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode). Talking about Vite, you can find more information here [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
